Tic-Tac-Toe Game Overview

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game that is played on a 3x3 grid. The objective of the game is for one player to place their mark (either "X" or "O") in such a way that they form a line of three of their marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The first player to achieve this wins the game. If the grid is filled and no player has won, the game results in a draw.

Game Rules:

1. Players: The game is played between two players. One player uses the "X" symbol, and the other player uses the "O" symbol. Player "X" always starts first.
2. Grid: The game is played on a 3x3 grid, which initially starts empty.
3. Objective: The goal is to place your marks (X or O) on the grid in such a way that you get three marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
4. Turns: Players take turns placing their marks on the grid. On each turn, a player selects an empty cell (row and column) to place their symbol.
5. Winning Condition: A player wins if they manage to place three of their marks in a row, whether it's horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
6. Draw Condition: If all the cells on the grid are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

Winning Patterns:

To win, a player must align their marks in one of the following patterns:

1. Horizontal line: Three marks in any of the three rows.
2. Vertical line: Three marks in any of the three columns.
3. Diagonal line: Three marks along either of the two diagonals.

End of the Game:

1. Winning: The game ends immediately when a player has aligned three marks in a row, and that player is declared the winner.
2. Draw: If all the spaces on the grid are filled, but no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
